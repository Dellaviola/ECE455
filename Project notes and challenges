SPI:
    Spelling mistake
    experimenting with baud rate to try and stop some led flickering, turns out a 1000 cycle delay was causing the flickering
    MB vs LSB, LSB used because the data will display in the same order it is sent

Timers:
    Start the Timers

Semaphores:
    Do they even work?

Queues and Yields:
    No protection on the queues caused unexpected behaviour when changing potentiometer
    Forcing the tasks to yield fixed this problem.
