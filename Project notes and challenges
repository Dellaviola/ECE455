SPI:
    Spelling mistake
    experimenting with baud rate to try and stop some led flickering, turns out a 1000 cycle delay was causing the flickering
    MB vs LSB, LSB used because the data will display in the same order it is sent

Timers:
    Start the Timers
    Software timer callbacks cannot block
    blocking ok in tasks, so event sync works.

Semaphores:
    Do they even work?
    Need to give on declaration
        
Queues and Yields:
    No protection on the queues caused unexpected behaviour when changing potentiometer
    Forcing the tasks to yield fixed this problem.

Event Bits:
    Used to set events and track the output states
    programmed in a deterministic fashion:
        Event Bits are:
            Set in callback functions
            Used in multiple tasks
            Cleared in task 4 ---- there should be some priority or protection, ensuring tasks 2 and 3 execute before 4

            maybe set a sync bit after task 2 and 3.

    Event bits, per documentation, are atomic operations by FreeRTOS implementation
